# Module 1 Challenge: Case Study
## The Rise of Banking as a Service (BaaS) and How Marqeta Became an Industry Leader
##
### **Introduction**
The concept of banking has been around since ancient Rome dating as far back as 300 BCE[1]. Even in the third century, banks were in the business of holding deposits and lending to individuals. Over the next 1700+ years, banks continued to hold deposits and lend, but the world of banking services has evolved drastically with technology. In just the last 20 years, the rise of the internet, mobile phones, payment technology, and fintechs has enabled the banking system to innovate at an accelerated pace. 

One of the largest and fastest growing sectors in banking is known as Banking as a Service (BaaS). BaaS is defined as using technology to connect existing banks and issuers with historically non-financial institutions through technology[2]. This connection facilitates new businesses to offer banking services such as cards, mortgages, loans, and more where they never had the infrastructure or expertise to do so previously. 

This case study will focus on Marqeta, one of the industry leaders in the BaaS space. 

### **Overview & Origin**
Marqeta was incorporated in 2010 officially establishing itself as a future leader in the fintech industry for the next decade and beyond[3]. The company was founded by Jason Garnder in 2009 with the mission to be the global standard for modern card issuing, empowering builders to bring the most innovative products to the world[4]. The platform enables companies to launch new products and programs with speed, flexibility, and scale in the fast changing and complex world of financial services and technology. 

Gardner, who still serves as the company’s Executive Chairman, is an experienced fintech leader and founder. Prior to founding Marqeta, he started a company called PropertyBridge in 2003, which focused on digitizing payments for residential real estate transactions[5]. The company was acquired almost 4 years later by MoneyGram International. Bringing his payments experience to the forefront of his next venture, Gardner had the idea for Marqeta while having dinner with a friend in San Francisco. His friend wanted to “put a bunch of coupons on a card.” Gardner said, “I found that kind of a cool idea, to see if we could solve that problem.” He was later quoted saying, “And the only way to solve that was build an issuing processing system from scratch.”[6] He saw the opportunity to simplify the card issuing process and Marqeta was born. 

The company has secured a number of different rounds of funding from prominent venture capital firms and investors prior to going public in June 2021. Before going public, Marqeta raised over $500M through series A through E offerings. Major investors included Visa, Goldman Sach, Vitruvian Partners, Spark Capital, Greyhound Capital, ICONIQ, and more[7]. The company then went public and raised $1.2B from class A common stock. Today, Marqeta’s market capitalization is $2.6B[8]. 

### **Business Activities**
Marqeta is addressing the outdated and rigid payments infrastructure that has been present in the banking industry since inception. Previously companies needed to work directly with a bank to offer these services, which may take years. Changing demands of customers, the inadaptability of different technologies across industry participants, and the pace of innovation at traditional banks has created a large opportunity for disruptors like Marqeta to enter the space. 

Marqeta is not a bank, however it connects financial institutions to companies that were previously unable to offer banking services to their customers and enables them to do so quickly and efficiently. According to CB Insights, there are a number of domains where Marqeta has inserted itself and helped maximize card issuing across a number of industries[9]. First, on-demand services like Doordash, Uber, and Instacart. These companies use Marqeta’s card for gig workers to pay for orders at restaurants and grocery stores. Second, buy-now-pay-later, companies like Affirm and Klarna use cards issued by Marqeta to pay merchants on behalf of their customers. Third, corporate card providers, they provide corporate cards to companies like Brex and Ramp. Fourth, digital banks and other financial institutions. This speaks volumes to the quality of service Marqeta is providing. Square, JPMorgan, and Goldman all use Marqeta for virtual cards or debit card issuing. These are companies that could issue the cards themselves, but choose to partner with Marqeta. There is no particular ones-size-fits-all customer for Marqeta. If a company wants to issue a card and increase its brand by putting a white labeled card in the hands of its customers, Marqeta is the solution. 

There are a number of other players in the BaaS space. Most prominent and largest competitor of Marqeta is Galileo. Galileo was founded in 2000 and was sold to SoFi. Galileo started in the prepaid card space, expanded to debit cards, and now has a platform with a broader range of financial services[10]. Marqeta sets itself apart by offering highly customizable and configurable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Their suite of APIs allows for businesses to seamlessly integrate into Marqeta’s platform and create extremely granular and custom functionality for their customer’s applications[11]. Although Galileo has cards, they are much stronger in the neo-bank space[12]. They empower smaller financial institutions looking to build their own digital bank, while Marqeta focuses on larger eCommerce or Financial institutions planning to add a card offering. 

Marqeta’s tech stack is quite complex with over 40 different technologies[13]. The company is built on a mixture of Python, Java, and Ruby. In terms of cloud-based data warehouses,they use MongoDB, Snowflake, and Amazon S3. Most code is stored on GitHub and Docker. According to their developer community, they are using these technologies to create some very interesting ideas. One solution that sticks out is called “Sushi Boat.”[14] It was created to automate the 25,000 tests they run before pushing code to production. Pieces of this were manual, lived in different environments, and were not streamlined. Sushi Boat is a one-stop shop for creating services and applications in their containerized Docker environment. It is a collection of source code clones that tests all their applications and dependencies within one package they refer to as “the boat.” The creation of Sushi Boat has enabled the developers to push code more easily and test with greater certainty. 

### **Landscape**
Financial services is made up of three key domains which include wealth management, insurance, and banking. BaaS falls squarely into the banking category enabling those companies that previously weren’t able to offer bankings services to their customers. 

In the last 5-10 years, banking has evolved tremendously with technology. Smartphones have been at the pinnacle of this disruption, where consumers are now able to check their balances, deposit checks, and even get pre-approved for a loan all within the palm of their hand. The rise of mobile banking has also disrupted the products and services consumers are able to take advantage of. Virtual debit and credit cards are now the norm in major cities through Apple and Android Pay. Finally, the concept of open banking and aggregators like Plaid have made it easier than ever before to sign into your bank account, make payments, and connect your accounts together for income verification, tax planning, and net worth tracking. Through these different technologies banking has evolved more in the last 5-10 years than ever before. 

Although banking has evolved in the last 5-10 years, can banks remain competitive? According to McKinsey, the banking sector is at a turning point[15]. Historically, traditional banks like Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi have owned the sector. These traditional banks have been a convenient one-stop shop for businesses and consumers, but their products haven’t evolved quickly enough to outpace technology companies. McKinsey believes there’s a  $20T opportunity in banking over the next decade, but these banks will need to innovate and disrupt faster than ever before to compete with technology companies like Amazon, Google, and others who have recently entered the financial services space.

### **Results**
Marqeta has had great success since its inception in 2010. The business impact of its technology has created an ecosystem of solutions available to its customers. These solutions include card issuing, expense management, instant installment loans, banking products, and rewards programs. The impact of these products has netted $217M in revenue in Q1 2023, which is up 31% from the same period last year[16]. In addition to posting favorable revenue growth, they also grew total transactions on the platform from $37B to $50B over the same period. Their suite of APIs has grown to over 370+ end points continuing its mission to provide customers flexibility to build their solutions. 

Galileo, Marqeta’s biggest competitor, also posted very favorable earnings in Q1 of this year[17]. Adjusted net revenue grew over 43% last year from $321M to $460M. This was largely due to its new lending platform that did $1BM in personal loan origination volume. Cards grew about $76M YoY. If we compare Marqeta and Galileo, Marqeta is out performing Galileo in cards, while Galileo is winning at loans.

### **Recommendations**
BaaS has revolutionized how companies think about providing financial services to their current customer base. Marqeta’s platform enables eCommerce, transportation, grocery, delivery, and other companies to attract and retain customers through financial services offerings. If I could recommend a new product to Marqeta, I’d pitch a Home Equity Line of Credit or HELOC. A HELOC is best defined as a line of credit against the equity in one's home issued through a card and now is the time to do it.

The macroeconomic environment has created an opportunity for this product. During COVID, interest rates were at zero which caused a mortgage refinance boom. In fact, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, there were over $700B mortgage originations in 2020 and 2021[18]. With consumers locking in record low interest rates, they were able to bring down their monthly payment and build equity at a faster rate. Because rates are now high, mortgage markets have suffered and originators are struggling. Marqeta offering an out-of-the-box HELOC solution would help mortgage companies during this time of low origination volume. Marqeta would be able to diversify revenue streams and create a bigger footprint in the loan origination space which is currently owned by Galileo.

To stand up this product, Maqeta’s engineers would need to enhance their APIs to be compatible with Loan Origination Systems (LOS).  The API would need to be robust enough to search for the customer, retrieve financial data, make an underwriting decision, and ultimately approve or deny the individual[19]. After the decision is made, the HELOC approval would be sent to one of Marqeta’s banking partners for fulfillment and then sent back to the mortgage company. This type of referral partnership can be extremely lucrative for the business. In fact, Galileo’s referral loans netted them over $44M in revenue in Q1 2023[20]. If Marqeta was able to enter this space, I believe they would share similar success.
